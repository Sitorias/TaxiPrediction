    "- **VendorID**: *A code indicating the TPEP provider that provided that record.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: TPEP (short for Technology Passenger Enhancements Project) introduced new technologies into the cabs, that should enhance the experience for the passenger. These systems automatically collect and send data about the trip, incoporate electronic message transmission capability, provide additional information to the passenger (e.g. a map) and enable the acceptance of credit/debit cards (see http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/taxicab_serv_enh_archive.shtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: If the TPEP system is used to calculate the fare in the end, then there might be a biased based on the system or the provider of the system in use. It should be further investigated if such a bias exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tpep_pickup_datetime:** *The date and time when the meter was enganged.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: It should be checked if all data points use the same date format since data most likely comes from different TPEP systems. This can be used to define relevant time frames for rushhour and overnight charges. Also duration of the ride (tpep_pickup_datetime - tpep_dropoff_datetime) probably has a direct influence on the total price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **tpep_dropoff_datetime:** *The date and time when the meter was disengaged.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: See tpep_pickup_datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Passenger_count:** *The number of passengers in the vehicle. This is a driver-entered value.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: Not sure if affecting outcome. Since it is driver-entered, there might be some data points missing or have a default value when it was not relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trip_distance:** *The elapsed trip distance in miles reported by the taximeter.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: One of the most important variables, linear influence on the total price expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pickup_longitude:** *Longitude where the meter was engaged.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: Can be used together with Pickup_latitude and Dropoff_longitude/Dropoff_latitude, to find geographical clusters of more expensive areas. If those do not exist, could be irrelevant as distance travel is stored in trip_distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pickup_latitude:** *Latitude where the meter was engaged.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Comment: See Pickup_latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RateCodeID:** *The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip. 1=Standard rate, 2=JFK, 3=Newark, 4=Nassau or Westchester, 5=Negotiated fare, 6=Group ride*\n",

    "## RateCodeID and its meaning\n",
    "The RateCodeID field specifies which rate of fare was used in the ride. There are six options:  \n",
    " 1. Standard rate, \n",
    " 2. JFK, \n",
    " 3. Newark, \n",
    " 4. Nassau or Westchester, \n",
    " 5. Negotiated fare, \n",
    " 6. Group ride\n",
    " \n",
    "In the following, we will have a closer look, how the different rates affect the total price. The information is partly taken from http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/passenger/taxicab_rate.shtml. Note that no matter what rate is used that there are no extra charges for extra passengers or luggage transported in the interior of the taxicab or for use of the taxicab's trunk.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Standard rate\n",
    "Here the initial charge for the ride is 2.50\\$. After that it is 50 cents per 1/5 of a mile, when the cab has a speed of atleast six miles per hour (taken from FAQ), or 50 cents per 60 seconds in slow traffic (speed is less than six miles per hour) or when the vehicle is stopped. Partial units of this measurement may be added if needed. There is a 50 cent MTA State surcharge for all trips that in in New York City or Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange or Putnam Counties. This fee is included in the data set and does not need further processing. The 30-cent improvement surcharge, the 50-cent surcharge from 8pm to 6am (i.e. overnight), the $1 surcharge from 4pm to 8pm on weekdays, excluding holydays (i.e. rushhour) are also already included in the data set. Bridge and tunnel tolls have to be paid by the passenger (see tolls_amount). Extra passengers or bags are free. There are no additional fees for paying with credit/debit/prepaid card.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JFK (John F. Kennedy Airport trip)\n",
    "Any trips from or to the JFK airport to or from any location in Manhattan has a flat fare of 52\\$ plus tolls. The 50-cent MTA State surcharge, 30-cent Improvement Surcharge and an additional 4.50\\$ rush hour surcharge (4PM to 8 PM on weekdays, exlcuding holidays) are applied here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newark\n",
    "Similar to JFK there is a special rate of fare for trips to the Newark airport. Here the standard metered rate above is used plus an additional 17.50\\$ Newark Surcharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nassau or Westchester\n",
    "For rides that start in Manhatten and end in Westchester or Nassau Counties, the standard rate is used within Manhatten. As soon as the town borders are crossed the metered fare is doubled until the destination is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negotiated fare\n",
    "Trips to destinations outside the city that are not covered above fall under a sepcial category. Here the driver and the passengers negotiate a fare amount which is then used for a ride. The 50-cent MTA State surcharge and the 30-cent Improvement Surcharge are added to the fare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group ride\n",
    "There are two special routes with special rates for groups of two to four people. Each route has a specific pickup and end location. For the route starting at **Port Authority Bus** the fare is 3.00\\$ per person. The route from **York Avenue** costs 6.00\\$ per person. In both cases one passenger has to pay the 50-cent MTA State Surcharge. Group rides happen from 6 am to 10 am on monday to friday (excluding holidays)."
